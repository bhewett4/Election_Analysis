# Election_Analysis
## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given me the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote

## Resources
 - Data Source: election_results.csv
 - Software: Python 3.10.2, Visual Studio Code 1.63.2

## Summary
The analysis of the election show that:
 - There were 369,711 votes cast
 - The candidates were:
    - Charles Casper Stockham
    - Diana DeGette
    - Raymon Anthony Doane
 - The candidate results were:
    - Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% of the vote which was 85,213 votes
    - Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the votes which was 272,892 votes
    - Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the votes which was 11,606 votes
 - The winner of the election was:
    - Diana DeGette who received 73.8% of the votes which was 272,892 votes

## Challenge Overview
In our initial analysis, we gave Seth, the Colorado Board of Elections employee 5 deliverables as notated above however I will reference them again:

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote

This information gave Seth quite a bit of insight into the election results, however the election committe asked for some additional data points:

1. The voter turnout for each county
2. The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
3. The county with the highest turnout
